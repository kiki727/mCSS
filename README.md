css components 

components are pure css,no js(except for sidenav), 
i use it for my Mithril.js apps..
I plan to evolve this project more, 
who knows maybe it become framework.

For now, there is basic grid system, 
and components desighned in css to loock like w10 setup window...

just download and open it in browser...
in Css fies are coments how to use components and classes, 
or you can look in index.html for more info.
